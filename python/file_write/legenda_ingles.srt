1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,034
Morty, hurry!

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,836
Return the Truth Tortoise!

3
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,238
Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,539
Also really important,

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,141
whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

6
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,844
I... I did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

7
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,579
Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,481
Good job! Way to go!
You [bleep] everything up!

9
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,216
[ Speaking gibberish ]

10
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,651
It's in my head!
[ Screams ]

11
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,320
Ah!

12
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,489
[ Screams ]

13
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,559
Oh, geez, I... I can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

14
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,561
Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

15
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,663
Hey, Morty, let's watch some
interdimensional cable.

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,232
Remember how we used to do that?

17
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,000
Rick, I can't...
I can't go on.

18
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,336
I-I can't go on like this with the
Truth Tortoise shit in my head.

19
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,604
I-I wish you could just...

20
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,739
Erase the memory from your mind?

21
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,741
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

22
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,443
Come on, Morty, come with me.

23
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,546
After you.

24
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,381
What the hell is this?!

25
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,983
This, Morty, is my archive

26
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,719
of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove
